## Development

### Front end

I am very proud that we set and hit our goal of releasing Ammalgam’s dApp by end
of year. We have gated it by address, please reach out if you want an address to
be added. There are still some things that we are wrapping up and will add in
the coming weeks.


### Contracts

I had a few epiphanies this month and shared them with a few of you already. I
think about it like the classic James Bond airplane nose dive where they always
pull out just before hitting the ground. We can force all positions to have this
property with minimal impact to our current engineering roadmap. I originally
thought we would need to modify our swap mechanism, but have since realized we
can implement an even simpler version and then iterate on that for version 2.
Our prior plan for liquidations was good, but the new plan is great, and will
allow for much stronger security guarantees and potentially make it possible to
achieve formal verification.

## Raise

I am more confident every day in our product and team and investors are
noticing. The momentum has done a 180 since my last update. I imagine we will be
able to close in February, partially waiting on lawyers and the other part
waiting on DD if a lead does express interest in the round. It doesn’t look like
we need a lead at this point, but I wouldn’t exclude one either if the interest
is there.
