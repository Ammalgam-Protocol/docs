# March 2024

## tl;dr

- Closed Seed Round
- Expanded contract team from 1 - 4 engineers
- Actively recruiting another Front-End Dev & expanding GTM team

## Development

Last month, we added a new engineer, who has been an amazing addition
to the core team. The engineer was able to add value immediately and has taken
on a lot of complex work. We also moved one front-end engineer to contracts.
With these shifts and my time starting to free up post-raise, we have
effectively expanded the contract team from 1 to 4 engineers. The raising of
funds took a major toll on our velocity, but with that wrapping up, we are ready
to pick up the pace and finish strong.

We are also recruiting a second front-end developer (please reach out with any
referrals!) and continue UX research to make our UI more intuitive.

We are aiming to start our first audit with OxMacro around Memorial Day. 

## GTM

We started working with a Web 3.0 marketing consultant who has successfully
taken numerous DeFi projects to market.  We will be increasing our activity on
social media; as always, we appreciate any support.

This month, the team made progress on further fleshing out tokenomics, developed
a preliminary plan for a TVL round, and designed a points / incentive system.

We will soon initiate efforts to evaluate which L2s to launch on after mainnet
release.  If you have thoughts / ideas you want to share or helpful connections,
please reach out.

Details on the draft TVL incentives are below.  Please let us know if you have
feedback or are interested in providing liquidity for additional token
allocation (or have referrals who may be interested).
