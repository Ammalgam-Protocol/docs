# December 2024

## tl;dr

- New Year Goals
- First audit results soon, starting second audit in January
- On track to launch in March
- What’s next after launch? Vaults, think Fuse from Rari
- Sponsoring EthDenver
- Website Refresh launching soon

## New Year Goals

Last years goal was to get the contracts complete and get to market. We underestimated the work we
had left, or overestimated ourselves, but we got close in that the we were able to start audits in
November, and are on track for a March 2025 launch.

With the new year, I have been doing a lot of thinking about the goals moving forward now that the
primary goal of launching is starting to come to fruition. With that at top of mind, we have been
working on outlining our goals for 2025. Here are the rough goals for 2025

- $100 Million of TVL
- $700k earned protocol fees
- 10 Partnerships with recognizable brands or sizable liquidity providers
- Release Vaults to simplify UX and resolve fragmented liquidity (Similar to Fuse Vaults from Rari Capital)
- $2 Million raised to sustain operations until we can transition to using protocol fees

## Development

Our first audit will be wrapping up this month. We additionally have been working through the final
touches on liquidation logic as the audit has progressed. Additionally, we have been working on
updating our peripheral contracts and front end to work with the latest interface of the core
contracts.

### Front end Development

With the contracts mostly complete, more effort has been going into wrapping up the pending work we
need to get done to launch a Beta App and start launching across various test networks.

### Planing Vaults

Our protocol will have similar issues to Rari Capital in that liquidity for one token will be split
across multiple different token pairs. Thus it makes sense to layer a vault system on top of the
core pairs to help simplify UX for depositing single assets without needing to fight with the brain
damage of what pair to deploy too.

In addition to single asset vaults, we will also be rolling out market making vaults that will
capture value by leveraging our technical understanding of how our protocol can be arbitraged with
other DEX’s. In addition to capturing value, they will help to ensure borrowed liquidity
