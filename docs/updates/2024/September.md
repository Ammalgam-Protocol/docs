# September 2024

## tl;dr

- Starting Audits in November
- We had a great start on rolling out our go-to-market plans, much more to do and to come.

## Development

We are very close to code complete on the contract side and working with 0xMacro to finalize a start date in November for the audit. We will be making releases throughout the month to merge finalized versions of each code complete feature. Liquidations is the feature that will require the most effort this month to finalize, but we are going into audits regardless and communicating that the final version of liquidations may get merged at the final hour and should be reviewed last. 

The front end engineers are working on adapting the front end to accommodate the changes to the core contracts and preparing the beta version that we intend to launch in December. 

Last month our front end team spent some time enhancing the dApp landing page to have a better onboarding flow that captures where people are hearing about our product to help us measure attribution of our marketing efforts.
