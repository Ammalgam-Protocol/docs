## Development

The remaining work we have to do includes three high level items, interest logic, saturation logic, and liquidations. With some of the major pieces of code starting to finalize, we have shifted engineering resources back to the frontend to work out our alpha kinks and upgrade to the latest core contract interfaces. This last week they were able to spin out a new flow in our alpha dapp to help encourage interested users to spread the word and capture influence attribution.

## Interest

We have deployed a prerelease interest rate logic. This is a big milestone as it allows for us to finalize designs on the front end to show accrued interest.

### Saturation

We have a code complete version of the saturation work that is going through code review. There are optimizations here that we will want to tackle before merging and releasing that will lower contract size and gas costs.

### Liquidations

We have been grooming the changes required to support the required changes to support liquidations. These changes will rely heavily on work already done, but will still require careful attention to be completed correctly. 

### Alpha Dapp onboarding flow

We revamped the landing page of our Dapp to do a better job of encouraging people to share online and to be able to track attribution for anyone sharing about Ammalgam on the Redacted Flight. At time of writing, there are still some finishing touches going in, but it will be live tomorrow.  A similar form will also be available for the redacted flight.
