## tl;dr

- Announcing the launch of our [Beta](https://beta.ammalgam.xyz) next week
- Spearbit audit competition starting at the end of the month
- Launching end of June or beginning of July
- Pitching LPs on incentives

## Development

We are about finished up with the feedback from auditors. There were some needed refactors we had to
do as we were right at the EVM limit for code bytes and having to figure out ways of reducing the
code footprint, or ways moving things out of our largest contract.

Excited to be ready to launch the [Beta](https://beta.ammalgam.xyz) version of our app. Would love
to get any feedback you have on it. We will now be focusing on updating the front end to the latest
version of the core contracts, fixing any bugs we find or get shared with us, and working on
incorporating indexed data to improve performance loading the site.
