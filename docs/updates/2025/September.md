## tl;dr

- Making progress through audit issues
- Successful event at Token2049

## Development

We continue to work through the issues raised in the Audit. We were able to review and plan fixes
for the majority of the issues raised, as well as make progress towards implementing the fixes. It’s
still difficult to project how long it will take to fix, but we are getting close!

## Marketing

We had a super successful event at Token2049 with over 100 attendees, 1000 registrations, and 4000
impressions on the Luma page. For the first time, we added speakers to the event and had a great
[conversation about hedging impermanent loss using
options](https://x.com/ammalgam/status/1983270781766512845) that included Sean from Derive and
Phoebe from DWF options.

### Marketing Analytics

We saw a decrease in followers on X due to a site-wide bot account removal. Combined with the
previous month’s Sonic investment announcement, this also reduced impressions.

However, verified followers continued to grow, confirming bots were the source of the drop. Overall,
these changes improved our follower-to-engagement ratio and audience quality.

Inactive Discord accounts continued to be pruned from the Discord to promote high quality community
members, with our ambassador program continuing to grow.

Also, it should be noted that there was an extreme outlier for “Average Session Duration”, typically
this is about 2 minutes.
