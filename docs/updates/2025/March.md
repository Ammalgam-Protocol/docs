# March

## tl;dr

- We have preliminary reports from both auditors
- Based on audit results, we are exploring a small audit competition
- We are aiming for May Mainnet release, but the above item would delay us 
  to June
- We will be releasing a Beta release of the front end soon in the next few 
  weeks

## Development

We have preliminary audit reports from both auditors. We are about 60% of 
the way through the fixes. We are aiming to complete them this month before 
having the auditors review. I created 
[this page](https://www.notion.so/Changes-Post-Audit-1d23195c2bf58019a357eba69861f832?pvs=21)
to give the auditors a snapshot of where we are at. We want to finish 
changes by the end of this month before getting a final review from the 
auditors.

It was both fortunate to have two auditors who were able to find critical 
issues that we missed, and unfortunate that each auditor found a distinct 
critical issue that the other auditor did not find. I want to have the 
confidence that those are the only two issues, but taking a moment to triple 
check by considering a code audit competition.    

On the front end, our goal is to release the beta version of the app by the 
end of the month. Rebuilding validation on the front end has been slower 
than I had hoped due to complexity. We want to have a smooth user experience 
without failed transactions due to gaps between the front end and the 
contracts before we release a beta version.

## Go to Market

We have been in contact with a number of chains, LPs, apps, investors and 
curators and will continue outreach to the community to make sure everyone 
knows we are coming. With our incentive plan for early adopters finalized, 
we are working to distribute the terms through various channels.

We plan to have enough progress with LP conversations before we launch. Next 
month we should have a better idea of how we are progressing.
