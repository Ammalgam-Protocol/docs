## Development

I am thrilled with the results from Cantina. We saw things uncovered that were missed in all the
prior audits that gives a reassurance that the comprehension of the audit was the best we have seen
yet, and honestly probably the best security ROI.

I spent a significant amount of time this month reviewing submissions on Cantina. They do a good job
of sifting through the low hanging fruit, but a lot of low quality AI slop findings still made it
through both their AI review and manual review by their judges. One of the complaints I have heard
through the grapevine is the amount of time it takes to get final results. Having now gone through
it, the judging process is the most cumbersome due to the sheer volume of mixed quality submissions.

As a team we have been able to groom through about 2/3rds of the findings and develop
