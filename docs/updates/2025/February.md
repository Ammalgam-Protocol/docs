# February

## tl;dr

- We have [completed our audit report from OxMacro](https://x.com/duelinggalois/status/1900614599831154930)
- ChainSecurity report has been delayed twice, but should be available 
  before the end of March
- Aiming to Launch in April considering audit delays as well as front end to dos
- Lots of momentum at EthDenver

## General

For as long as I can remember, our north star has been to complete the code 
and start audits and launch. Now that we have hit that milestone, and have a 
preliminary audit report, a whole new set of tasks have surfaced. The 
dilemma now is to launch as fast as possible, but we are building the bridge as 
we cross it, and need to make sure we have all the pieces in place to launch 
successfully. We are prioritizing the things that have to happen before 
launch. These fall in the category of getting sufficient LP commitments for 
launch and front end improvements to make sure the user experience is solid.

## Development

The fixes for the first audit are not difficult.  We may have more 
time-consuming work to get our primary contract to fit in the allotted size 
allowed in the EVM, but we have gotten quite good about finding ways to 
squeeze more in, or finding something to move out.

We don’t yet know what will come out of the second audit, so still can't say 
for sure that there will not be delays on that end for sure, but we are 
hopeful that there will not be any major delays.

We still have work in the front end, the validation logic that happens in 
the core contracts needs to be replicated in the front end to make sure 
users can’t ask the front end to create a transaction that the contracts 
will reject. The complexity of this development is not trivial.   

We have gotten a bunch of use due to Monad extending access to their Layer 3 
campaign, and it has been great to see that all the things I am worried 
about fixing are not the issues we are getting feedback about. The biggest 
friction was that users needed a back button to put in a different code. 
Still waiting for someone to give quality feedback on the real issues, which 
might signal to the quality of user we are seeing.
