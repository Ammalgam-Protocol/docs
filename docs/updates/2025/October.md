## tl;dr

- Updated Estimate of Launch December Launch March 2026 TGE
- Incentive and pre-deposit plan updates
- Trying something new [first X AMA tomorrow](https://x.com/ammalgam/status/1986190049071796638)

## Development

I have been trying to hold off throwing out dates to be a bit more cautious about over promising
timelines, as I am consistently overestimating our capacity and underestimating the complexity. Here
are our proposed dates. Please keep in mind that there is still a real possibility of things coming
up that delay us, especially if any additional concerns are raised by auditors.

- November 15th: Code Freeze
- November 28th: Confirmation of fixes from auditors
- December: Goal to launch
- March 2026: TGE

## Marketing

With Monad farmers stopping activity due to the airdrop being finalized, almost all metrics are down
for this month, but expected to stabilize and begin growing again from this month onwards.

X continues to clear out bot activity and accounts, but most of the bots/farm accounts that were
following us are already gone following the initial purge. Our intern account was less active this
month as we planned to launch our mascot and repurpose the account to be used for our new mascot -
it will be more active going forwards and the mascot transition is planned to occur once we launch
vaults.

### Pre-deposit vault strategy

Due to the novelty of our protocol, we have been thinking of ways to attract liquidity without going
completely risk on day one. We are talking to Wildcat Finance and Gauntlet about setting up a way
for us to take funds, deploy them into existing DeFi strategies, like the Gauntlet Frontier Vault on
Morpho, and then gradually move liquidity into the protocol over time once we launch.

I learned that the market for liquidity gets really small when you say the words impermanent loss,
and this is the main thing we need! So as we move liquidity from the pre-deposit vaults, we will
have a lower vault that is able to deploy the assets into market making strategies on Ammalgam and
hedging the impermanent loss with both out-of-the-money options and token incentives. These vaults
will have 4 or fewer asset types: stables, ETH, BTC, and Sonic S. We have discussed this strategy
with a few teams that might be able to work with us, but it also might be something we roll out on
our own.

We will still be open to conversations about higher incentives for anyone willing to take on IL
exposure, but after everything I have learned from talking to LP’s, it doesn’t make sense to lead
with this.

I am working diligently to both finalize these details and delegate some of this work to our
marketing team. I will work to have a better, more concise update next month.
