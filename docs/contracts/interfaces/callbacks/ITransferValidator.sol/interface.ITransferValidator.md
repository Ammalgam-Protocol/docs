This interface is intended for validating the solvency of an account when transfers occur.


## Functions
### validateOnUpdate

Validates the solvency of an account for a given token transfer operation.

*Implementation should properly protect against any creation of new debt or transfer
of existing debt or collateral that would leave any individual address with insufficient collateral to cover all debts.*

function validateOnUpdate(address validate, address update) external;
```

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`validate`|`address`|The address of the account being checked for solvency and having its saturation updated|
