# Overview

## DLEX

We are building a completely new primitive that builds lending into a DEX that we call a Decentralized Lending Exchange (DLEX). Unutilized assets in a traditional DEX are lent out leveraging earned yields without increasing Impermanent Loss risk. This also unlocking the utility of having access to lending natively in a DEX allowing for AMM shares to be used as collateral to borrow against. Additionally, we built a mechanism to allow for borrow AMM shares themselves which can be used as a hedge for impermanent loss or to make straddles. The feedback we have gotten from sophisticated traders in the space is extremely positive because what we are building is so powerful and our UI makes the complexity intuitive and accessible.
