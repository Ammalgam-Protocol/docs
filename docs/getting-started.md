# Getting Started

## Connecting a Wallet
To begin using Ammalgam, visit https://beta.ammalgam.xyz/ and connect your wallet by clicking on the Connect Wallet button in the top right. You can use MetaMask or any supported browser wallet. Ensure your wallet is set to one of the supported test networks.

## Navigating the UI
The interface is organized into three main tabs:

- **Pools** – Lend and earn yield
- **Trade** – Open long or short positions, or swap tokens
- **DLEX** – Configure advanced strategy recipes with visual tools

The layout is designed for both passive users and advanced traders, giving everyone access to capital-efficient DeFi.

## Supported Networks
During the beta, Ammalgam is available on the following networks:

- Sepolia
- Arbitrum Sepolia
- Monad Testnet
- Botanix Testnet

Switch networks from the top-right dropdown menu in the app.

## Understanding the Dashboard
Once you connect your wallet, you'll access the Pools dashboard where you can access:

- Top liquidity pairs (e.g. DAI/USDC, USDC/WBTC)
- TVL (Total Value Locked)
- APY (Annual Percentage Yield) for each token

You can also:

- Claim test tokens via the Faucet
- View current strategy performance in the DLEX tab

## Quick Start

### Trade
Use the **Trade** tab to:

- Swap assets
- Open leveraged **Long** or **Short** positions

Select the tokens you want to trade, set the amount, and approve the transaction from your wallet.

### Deposit
Go to the Pools tab and select a liquidity pair. Choose which asset to deposit, approve the transaction, and confirm it from your wallet. Your deposited funds start earning yield immediately.

### Lend
Depositing into a pool simultaneously lends your assets. You earn interest from borrowers and trading fees from swaps.

As soon as you confirm your deposit, you start earning a yield. You can close your position and withdraw funds to your connected wallet.

### Borrow
Visit the Trade tab and choose Long or Short to initiate a borrow. Your existing deposits will be used as collateral. Margin and liquidation risk are automatically managed by the protocol.

### Try a Recipe
You can explore the available recipes from the DLEX tab:

- Select a pair and choose a strategy (e.g. Market Making, Straddle)
- Adjust parameters like exposure % and delta/gamma scores
- Preview outcomes via a live payout chart and heat map

You can monitor or exit recipe-based strategies from the pool interface from the **View Pool** button at the bottom.
